ðŸ‘‹ I'm a Web Developer from Sri Lanka. 

Foundation of my development carrier was from the [University of Colombo School of Computing](https://ucsc.cmb.ac.lk/), Sri Lanka.

My professional development career began in 2016 as a PHP developer. I could be able to enter the Laravel ecosystem at the end of 2017 and ever since Iâ€™m mastering the Laravel. My passion for development did not stop me there. I began to explore and master many more web based technologies such as Vue.js Inertia.js and more.
